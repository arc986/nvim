" ## Quick Start
" ### normal mode / visual mode
"   * start:          `<C-n>` start multicursor and add a _virtual cursor + selection_ on the match
"     * next:         `<C-n>` add a new _virtual cursor + selection_ on the next match
"     * skip:         `<C-x>` skip the next match
"     * prev:         `<C-p>` remove current _virtual cursor + selection_ and go back on previous match
"   * select all:     `<A-n>` start multicursor and directly select all matches

" You can now change the _virtual cursors + selection_ with **visual mode** commands.
" For instance: `c`, `s`, `I`, `A` work without any issues.
" You could also go to **normal mode** by pressing `v` and use normal commands there.

" At any time, you can press `<Esc>` to exit back to regular Vim.

" **NOTE**: start with `g<C-n>` to match without boundaries (behaves like `g*` instead of `*`)

" ### visual mode when multiple lines are selected
"   * start: `<C-n>` add _virtual cursors_ on each line

" You can now change the _virtual cursors_ with **normal mode** commands.
" For instance: `ciw`.

" ### command
" The command `MultipleCursorsFind` accepts a range and a pattern (regexp), it creates a _visual cursor_ at the end of each match.
" If no range is passed in, then it defaults to the entire buffer.


" ## Mapping
" If you don't like the plugin taking over your key bindings, you can turn it off and reassign them the way you want:
" ```viml
let g:multi_cursor_use_default_mapping=0

" Default mapping
let g:multi_cursor_start_word_key      = '<C-e>'
let g:multi_cursor_select_all_word_key = '<A-e>'
let g:multi_cursor_start_key           = 'g<C-e>'
let g:multi_cursor_select_all_key      = 'g<A-e>'
let g:multi_cursor_next_key            = '<C-e>'
let g:multi_cursor_prev_key            = '<C-p>'
let g:multi_cursor_skip_key            = '<C-x>'
let g:multi_cursor_quit_key            = '<Esc>'
